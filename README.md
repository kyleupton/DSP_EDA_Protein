# DSP_EDA_Protein

    This package contains a set of Jupyter notebooks and supporting R scripts to aid with DSP data visualisation, QC, data exploration, normalisation and analysis.

    The pipeline procedes through the following steps:
    
    Perform initial data QC and visualisation

    Start config file setup

    Confirm data quality and whether specific samples or probes should be excluded for technical reasons

    Explore and decide on data normalisation strategies (multiple levels and options)

    Set up groups for comparison

    Run data analysis (currently in edgeR)

    Convert analysis outputs to better looking figures (volcano plots and  heat-maps are currently generated from EdgeR outputs)

## Getting started
